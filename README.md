# Portfolio

## Description
This is my portfolio website, showcasing my work and skills as an Interactive Media Development student at Algonquin College, aspiring to become a professional web developer. The site includes three pages: Home, About, and Projects. It is built using the Bootstrap framework and adheres to modern web development best practices.

## Process
The development process started with creating a detailed design for all three pages, considering the mobile-first approach. Bootstrap was used to ensure responsiveness and to speed up the development process. Custom CSS was applied to enhance the default Bootstrap styling and to make the website more personalized.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Responsiveness**: Ensuring that the website looked good on all devices was challenging. Bootstrap's grid system and responsive utilities made this easier.
- **Optimization**: Optimizing images for different screen sizes was managed using the `<picture>` element and appropriate `srcset` attributes.
- **Accessibility**: Adding `alt` text to images and using ARIA roles helped improve the accessibility of the website.

## Learnings
- Improved understanding of Bootstrap and its features.
- Enhanced skills in responsive design and accessibility.
- Learned how to optimize images for better performance.

## Assets and Resources
- **Frameworks**: [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts
- **Images**: Stock images from Adobe Stock with acquied licenses.
